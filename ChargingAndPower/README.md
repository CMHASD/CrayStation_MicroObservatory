# Charging and Power

## Purpose

We aim to power the CrayStation Micro Observatory from Solar Panels, charging during the day and running off batteries at night.
Ideal outcome is we can run every night all year - but we think this might not be pratical. The key here is careful consideration to parts. We have to think about idle current, wake up modes and running current.

## Some Stats

_(this will change as we drill down onto the final design) values are estimates ultimatly we need to measure)_

| Board | Idle (A) | Idle Power Consumption (W) | Tested/Researched |
| - | :- | :- | -: |
| Bare Raspberry Pi 4B | 600mA 5v| 3W | looked up |
| Pico W (wifi connected) | 50mA 5v|0.25W | looked up |
| Seestar S50 | 1-1.5A 12v| 12-18 W |based on Battery and quoted battery life |
