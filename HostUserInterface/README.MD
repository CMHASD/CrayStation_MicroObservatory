# HostUser Interface

The CrayStation Micro Observatory, is designed to work autonomously in a domestic setting, e.g. from the roof of a friend or relatives garage or shed. The HostUser Interface is their way of interacting with the CrayStation RemoteObservatory.
The HostUser may also have RemoteObserver access, that role and the user interfaces for it are discussed elsewhere.

## Definitions

**HostUser**:  The friend or relative who will host the CrayStation on their property.\
**RemoteAdmin**: The Person, remote from the observing site responsible for administration of the CrayStation Micro Observatory\
**RemoteObserver**: The Person Using the CrayStation Micro Observatory

## Expectations of the HostUser

- The HostUser does not need any astronomical, IT or electronics knowledge.
- The HostUser may be required to press buttons under the guidance of the RemoteAdmin user
- The HostUser may be required to read a display on the CrayStation Micro Observatory

## The Host User Interface

The Host user interface needs to provide some basic information for the host user, in a way that requires no knowledge to understand for example (this list will change)...

1. Battery Status
2. Charging Status
3. Remote User Connection Status
4. Storage Usage?
5. Wifi Connection Status
6. CrayStation Status

There will also be a number of maintenance buttons for example (this list will change)...

1. Open / Close CrayStation Enclosure
2. Reboot Primary or Secondary computer

## Implementation

The HostUser interface will likely be implemented using an Arduino Nano
