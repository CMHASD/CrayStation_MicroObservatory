### CrayStation_MicroObservatory

## Concept

Develop a solar powered, micro-observatory requiring no intervention from the host site to operate on a Night by Night Basis. The only requirement for the remote site is a flat surface and a Wifi Connection.

The project will be split into a number of parts, which together will form the CrayStation Micro Observatory.

1.  A powered, opening enclosure, remotely controlled.
2.  A Seestar S50 smart telescope, remotely controlled.
3.  an all-sky camera, scripted and remotely controlled.
4.  weather station, remotely controlled.
5.  Host User Interface, controlled locally, viewable remotly.
6.  Solar Panel charging and battery charging circuit 
7.  Security - Authentication and management of remote users, no 'reverse' access into hosts network.

The overall Package will be designed to be built and then delivered to site.

## Constraints

These constraints cover the whole project, other constraint may exist for the individual modules 

1.  **Power** - _There will be a power budget - to be defined_
2.  **Usability** - _The CrayStation will be easy to use for the Host and Remote User._
3. **Small Footprint** -_ The project will take up a small amount of space so as to minimise the impact on the host site._
4.  **Multiple Users** - _The project will be designed for multiple remote users_
5.  **Unreliable Wifi** - _The project will assume the wifi is unreliable, slow and dynamically sets the IP address. _
6.  **Budget** - This is meant to be acheivable for a modest budget of under Â£1000
