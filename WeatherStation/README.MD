# Weather Station

## Purpose

The weather station is designed primarialy to assess weather conditions for the Micro Observatory rather than to measure or predict the weather. As well as checking the condittions we hope to use the weather data to prevent 'poor' user decissions, such as opening the micro observatory when it is raining. So the Micro controller needs to pass this information back to the controlling software. 

## Sensors

- Temperature, Humidity, Pressure (one sensor)
- rain detector
